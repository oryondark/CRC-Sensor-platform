### Sensor platform born-project.

#### 1. GPS tracking and Oximetry Collecting, with Visualization
[GPS project](https://github.com/oryondark/CRC-Sensor-platform/tree/master/track_gps)<br>
[Oximetry](https://github.com/oryondark/CRC-Sensor-platform/tree/master/oxyhrmMonitor)<br>

#### 2. Sensor platform with ElasticSearch
[ElastiSearch Guide](https://github.com/oryondark/CRC-Sensor-platform/tree/master/MachineLearning_example/climate_dashboard_withES)<br>
[AWS IoT with ES Role](https://github.com/oryondark/CRC-Sensor-platform/tree/master/AWS_IoT_withES_RoleSetup)

#### 3. Machine Learning Example using Arduino NANO 33 BLE SENSE
a. Punch/Flex Example but i just use dataset only. so deep learning model did not provide.<br>
